                    <p>I've been trying to be a little bit different since I was child, when I was growing up I had to adjust with the rules of the world. I didn't success , but I didn't give up either. I thought I had studied the other side, but what happened ? So I moved towards the computer and now I want to move forward in life with Programming at Computer -Science. I need a platform to show my skills and prove  that Iâ€™m the best.  Anyway, I talked a lot, thank you.</p>
